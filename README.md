# Pac-Man-Board
Navigation of Pac-Man on a 2D board covered in coins to be picked.
The pacman class and the helper functions are written in the 'pacman.py' module. 
The 'main.py' file runs only the 'test.txt' file. Any custom 'test.txt' file can be provided to this main file.
The 'main_multiple.py' file takes all test input files " 'test1.txt', 'test2.txt' ... 'test11.txt' " and outputs it all onto the terminal.
